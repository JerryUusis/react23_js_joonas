// Guess what answers you would get if you ran this in the Javascript Console.
// Once you have an answer to the questions then check them by copying them and
// running it in the console yourself line by line.

//Evaluate the below:
something! // Your guess goes here
3 + "65" // "365" (Plus operator turns integers to strings if the types are different)
7 - "3" // 4 (Minus operator has only mathematical "meaning" so it will turn string in to integer)
15 % 5 // 0
5 % 15 // 5
"Java" + "Script" // "JavaScript"
"Java" - "Script" // NaN
" " + " " // "  "
" " + 0 // " 0"
true + true // 2 (true has numerical value of 1)
true + false // 1 (false has numberical value of 0)
false + true // 1
false - true // -1  
3 - 4 // -1


//Evaluate the below comparisons:
4 >= 2 // true
6 === 2 // false
2 == 2 // true
2 == '2' // true
2 === '2' // false
3 <= 1 // false
1 != 1 // false
"A" > "B" // false (In ASCII printable characters code capital letters come before small case letters)
"B" < "C" // true
"a" > "A" // true
"b" < "A" // false
true === false // false
true != true // false 


// Make the string: 
// "Go To Helsinki Business College," they said. "It'll Will Be "Fun"," they said.
// by using the + sign:

'"Go To Helsinki Business College," ' + "they said. " + "It'll Will Be " + '"Fun"," they said.';
